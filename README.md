## Features

- Shows the VCS branch and whether it's dirty (with a `*`) or wether it has
staged files (with a `+`).
- Indicates when you have unpushed/unpulled `git` commits with up/down arrows.
- If the command didn't exit with `0`:
    - The prompt character turns red
    - The exit code is displayed before the prompt character
- Username and host only displayed when in an SSH session.
- Shows the current path in the title and the current folder & command when a process is running.
- Makes an excellent starting point for your own custom prompt.
- Has SVN and Mercurial support.
- Shows Python virtualenv info.
